## Getting Started
---

### Install
Install the project dependencies by going to the project folder and running 

`npm install`

Once that's done, make sure to install MongoDB to your machine. Once that's done, you can run your mongo instance by running the `mongod` command


### Running it

In order to run the project, run the following commands in order, in separate terminal windows. (I know, I know. It sucks but haven't figured out a better way :(

If you're Mongo instance isn't running yet, run

`mongod`

then run the backend server application with

`npm start`

then run the front end with

`ng server`

*Make sure all are running in separate terminal/command prompt windows concurrently*

And you have a running app! You can visit the site with the default port at localhost:4200 in most browsers.
